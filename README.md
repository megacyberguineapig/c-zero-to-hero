# Lab 0 — Hello World (C-zero-to-hero)

🐹 MegaCyberGuineaPig begins the journey.

This is my first step learning C (C11). I’m an amateur ethical hacker documenting every lab, starting here with a classic Hello World program. 
I understand nobody will care about a hello world program, but I would just like to document my learning journey so that others and myself can see my progress. Every step counts and I want it etched in stone.
