# C Zero to Hero Learning Journey

I am new to C and programming in general. I am an amateur ethical hacker and I would like to learn C language to get a better understanding of how things work under the hood. I am a natural systems thinker.
I will document all of my progress including mistakes I've made, pitfalls, and things I've learned to become a better programmer.
I am using a combination of CHATGPT and resources such as books (Modern C, the C programming language etc) to learn the language.
